# Advent of code 2021
The WhiskeeDev way

---

For this year's [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/2021), I'm taking the simple route and working with the language I know best - Javascript.

To be more precise; Rather than creating javascript scripts or applications, in which I submit the inputs and get an answer, I'll be creating scripts that I can copy and paste into chrome devtools' console and have an returned object with the necessary answer(s).
